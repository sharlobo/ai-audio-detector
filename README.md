# AI Audio Detector

This project focuses on detecting AI-generated speech using a Wav2Vec2-based deep learning pipeline. The goal is to distinguish between authentic human speech and synthetic speech generated by modern TTS or voice cloning models. The system may also be extended to include video features (e.g., from VoxCeleb) to improve multimodal detection.

## Project Objectives

- Classify audio as real (human) or fake (AI-generated)
- Use Wav2Vec2 for extracting speech embeddings
- Train a binary classifier on top of Wav2Vec2
- (Optional) Integrate video/lip features using VoxCeleb
- Evaluate generalization across different AI voice synthesis models

## Technologies

- Hugging Face Transformers (Wav2Vec2)
- PyTorch and Torchaudio
- OpenCV / Dlib (optional for video)
- VoxCeleb dataset

## Setup

git clone https://github.com/sharlobo/ai-audio-detector.git
cd ai-audio-detector

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Getting Started

1. Add your real and AI-generated .wav files into data/raw/
2. Run scripts/extract_audio_feats.py to extract embeddings
3. Use training/train.py to train the classifier
4. Evaluate with training/eval.py

## Future Work

- Multiclass detection of specific synthesis models
- Lip-sync mismatch detection
- Cross-lingual AI audio detection
- Robustness testing (noise, pitch, reverb)
